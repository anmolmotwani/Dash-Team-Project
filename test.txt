Hello Team Project! 


-Ideas: We are going to create a dash app that displays weather in a given area

Use open-meteo to process the requests and give an overview of the weather. Allow the user to select from a range of 7 days in the past and 7 days in the future using "dcc.DatePickerSlider"

Use dcc.Input to get a country and city from the user and use geopy api to get the latitude and longitude of that place
(What do we do when someone puts in an answer with more than one viable location?)

All
